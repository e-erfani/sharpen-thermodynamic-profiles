# Adjusting thermodynamic vertical profiles of reanalysis data

This code utilizes satellite microwave observations of liquid water path (LWP) to modify reanalysis (in particular ERA5) temperature and moisture profiles. 
This is done by sharpening the profiles near the inversion level and is necessary for nudging the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) experiments. 
Without sharpening, the LES might not simulate the Stratocumulus cloud layer. This is done by finding the optimized profiles with the LWP equal to observed values.

- Inputs: Tl_ctrl = T_ctrl + g*z/Cp - (L/Cp)*qc, qt_era (= qv+qc), Microwave LWP, ERA Zinv. Note that Tl is the liquid-water static energy divided by Cp, and
          qt is total water mixing ratio.
          Note: ctrl refers to the initial ERA5 profile.
- Choose inversion height, zi: compute inversion height based on ERA ctrl profiles using min of d(RH)/dz*d(THETAL)/dz. 
                                Alternatively, use MODIS CTH.
- Build Tl(z) and qt(z) in two parts: FT and BL
- First FT: 

   o Let L_FT be some height above the inversion where ERA ctrl profiles don't "feel" the BL anymore, say 500m. 
   
   o For z>zi+L_FT:

   o For zi < z < zi+L_FT, fit a line to the ctrl Tl/qt profiles away from the inversion, and extrapolate down to the inversion. 
     This would be: Tl[zind2] = np.polyval(np.polyfit(z[zind], Tl_ctrl[zind], 1), z[zind2]) where zind are the indices where zi+L_FT < z < zi+3*L_FT 
     and zind2 has zi<z<zi+L_FT.  
   
   o Note: You might need to blend smoothly across zi+L_FT to avoid discontinuities.  
   
   o The top of the region where you're fitting the line is also arbitrary.  I chose  zi+3*L_FT as a reasonable first guess.

   o To ensure moisture profile sharpening above Zinv:

    where delta_qt_inv is the difference between FT qt and BL qt near the inversion level.    


- Within the BL

  o The whole temperature and moisture profiles within the BL are:

- How to solve:

  o takes inputs: Tl_ctrl(z), qt_ctrl(z), qt_inv, Tl_inv and ERA Zinv, and

  o follows the above scheme to produce outputs adj Tl(z) and ajd qt(z). (adj: adjusted).  

  o Make a second function that:

     - takes the inputs: Tl_ctrl(z), qt_ctrl(z), qt_inv, Tl_inv and Zinv along with LWP_target.
     - calls the first function to compute adj Tl(z) and adj qt(z)
     - computes the LWP of the resulting profile by computing LWC using saturation adjustment at each height, and
     - outputs a (positive) number that tells how well the resulting adj profile matches LWP_target while preserving the vertical integrals of the ERA ctrl Tl and qt profiles.

     F is equal to 0.3

  o Automate the process of determining qt_inv and Tl_inv by using a function like "fmin" that will vary those inputs and choose the values that minimize the output function.

### adjust_ERA5_profile_RF06_Tr2p3_2020-04-12.ipynb:

A few changes have been made:

- Make sure that in the FT, d(qt) / d(z) is always negative or zero right above the inversion level.
- Remove the equation containing the parameter delta_Tl_inv for the FT profile to avoid non-physical Tl lapse rate of zero.
- In addition to Tl_inv, qt_inv, and Zinv, two more variables are added to the minimization function: delta_qt_inv and F. The function changes all these variables in order to find the minimum value of variable "A". This ensures minimum arbitrary assumptions.
